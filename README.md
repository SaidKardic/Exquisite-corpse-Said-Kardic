# A man walks in a bar..

after a long day at work and orders a drink. As he sits there, mulling over his day, he hears a high-pitched voice say, "That shirt looks great on you!"

He turns his head and sees a human-size Duck!
-Oh, no! -- says the man, -Why are you so big? 
The Duck flutters its wings and is getting closer...
